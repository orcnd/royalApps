# Welcome 
I'm orcun and this is sample project for royalApps assignment

## How it works 
- works on php8 and uses sqlite3, prepare working envoriment for it
- clone the repo
- run `composer install` to install depencies 
- run `npm run build` to install node modules 
- run `php artisan serve` to start server 
- access it from http://127.0.0.1 

### Notes
database.sqlite and .env file removed from .gitignore to make testing process easier
